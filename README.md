# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This project was started as a project for Lighthouse Labs Web Development bootcamp, as a means of practicing full-stack development using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX for the front-end, and Node, Express and MongoDB for the back-end.
